# BA-IFSS: Bachelor Thesis Baseline Experiments

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:**
> This repository contains the source code for the **baseline models** (IFSS-Net, VGG, TransUNet) and early experimental runs analyzed in the Bachelor Thesis.
>
> For the **final End-to-End Pipeline** using the **SegFormer** architecture (which achieved the best performance), please visit the main repository:

## Overview
**BA-IFSS** (Bachelor Thesis on Interactive Few-Shot Siamese Network) serves as the experimental archive for the comparative study on 3D muscle segmentation.

This framework was used to evaluate and benchmark different deep learning architectures against the specific challenges of volumetric ultrasound data (e.g., *Vastus Lateralis* segmentation). It includes implementations and training scripts for:

* **IFSS-Net:** Interactive Few-Shot Siamese Network.
* **VGG:** Standard Convolutional Neural Network baseline.

The results and metrics (IoU, Loss) generated by this repository serve as the baseline for the performance comparison discussed in the thesis chapters regarding **Model Instability** and **Convergence Issues**.
